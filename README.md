# Layout2Lithography
Layout 2 Lithography repository for paper MPGNet: Leveraging Layout Priors and Structural Cues for High-Fidelity Lithography Simulation. 

Training logs can be downloaded in the /logs directory. The training and testing code of our proposed MPGNet have been open-sourced, so are our baseline implementation. All of our experiments were conducted on RTX3090 and logs are provided.

## Set up

You can set up your local environment using the "environment.yml" file. Virtual environment are recommended.
